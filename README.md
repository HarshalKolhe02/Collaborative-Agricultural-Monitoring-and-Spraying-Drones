# Collaborative Agricultural Monitoring and Spraying Drones

This project features a two-drone autonomous swarm designed for precision agriculture. The system uses a **Scanner Drone** to find crop issues and a **Sprayer Drone** to treat them with centimetre-level accuracy.

# Abstract
This work presents a dual-UAV system for the selective detection and treatment of stressed crops in agricultural fields. The objective is to reduce indiscriminate pesticide application by localising affected plants and performing targeted spraying using autonomous aerial platforms.

The system consists of two quadrotors operating sequentially: a scanning UAV and a spraying UAV. The scanning UAV is equipped with an onboard vision system and RTK-enabled GNSS for precise localisation. It performs autonomous coverage of a predefined area while detecting crop stress based on leaf colour variation using HSV colour-space segmentation. Detected pixel locations are transformed into global coordinates by incorporating camera parameters, vehicle altitude, and attitude data obtained from the flight controller. Each detected plant is geotagged and stored for mission planning.

The spraying UAV is a high-payload platform carrying a 10-litre pesticide tank and a high-pressure pump system. Based on the geotagged locations generated by the scanning UAV, the spraying UAV navigates to each target point. At close range, visual feedback from an onboard camera is used to compute lateral positioning error relative to the target, enabling fine alignment through closed-loop visual centring before spray actuation. A dual-nozzle configuration allows switching between wide-area and localised spraying depending on target clustering.

# Methodology 
## Structures
### Scanning Drone
The scanning drone frame is built using two 3D-printed ABS plates connected by 16 mm square carbon-fibre rods. A stainless steel plate is added at high-load regions to handle structural stresses during flight. An F550 landing gear is used to support safe takeoff and landing. The frame includes custom 3D-printed mounts for mounting the camera and flight computer, ensuring proper alignment and mechanical support.

### Spraying Drone
The spraying drone frame is constructed using carbon-fiber rods positioned between two carbon-fiber plates. The propulsion system consists of X6 motors powered by two 6S batteries connected in series. The landing gear is built using aluminium rods with custom mounts, providing ground clearance and structural support. A 10-litre pesticide tank is mounted between the landing gear legs. The drone is equipped with a [adaptive dual-nozzle spraying system](https://github.com/HarshalKolhe02/Adaptive-Dual-Nozzle-Sprayer), allowing selection between different spray patterns during operation.
